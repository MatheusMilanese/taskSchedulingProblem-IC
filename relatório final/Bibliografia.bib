    abstract = {The two-dimensional variable sized bin packing problem (2DVSBPP) is the problem of packing a set of rectangular items into a set of rectangular bins. The bins have different sizes and different costs, and the objective is to minimize the overall cost of bins used for packing the rectangles. We present an integer-linear formulation of the 2DVSBPP and introduce several lower bounds for the problem. By using Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition we are able to obtain lower bounds of very good quality. The LP-relaxation of the decomposed problem is solved through delayed column generation, and an exact algorithm based on branch-and-price is developed. The paper is concluded with a computational study, comparing the tightness of the various lower bounds, as well as the performance of the exact algorithm for instances with up to 100 items.}

Two heuristics, which belong to the class of packing procedures that preserve bottom-left (BL) stability, are hybridised with three meta-heuristic algorithms (genetic algorithms (GA), simulated annealing (SA), naı̈ve evolution (NE)) and local search heuristic (hill-climbing). This study compares the hybrid algorithms in terms of solution quality and computation time on a number of packing problems of different size. In order to show the effectiveness of the design of the different algorithms, their performance is compared to random search (RS) and heuristic packing routines.}

    abstract = {The two-dimensional orthogonal non-guillotine cutting problem (NGCP) appears in many industries (like wood and steel industries) and consists in cutting a rectangular master surface into a number of rectangular pieces, each with a given size and value. The pieces must be cut with their edges always parallel or orthogonal to the edges of the master surface (orthogonal cuts). The objective is to maximize the total value of the pieces cut. In this paper, we propose a two-level approach for solving the NGCP, where, at the first level, we select the subset of pieces to be packed into the master surface without specifying the layout, while at a second level we check only if a feasible packing layout exists. This approach has been already proposed by Fekete and Schepers [S.P. Fekete, J. Schepers, A new exact algorithm for general orthogonal d-dimensional knapsack problems, ESA 97, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1284 (1997) 144–156; S.P. Fekete, J.

Monaci, On the two-dimensional knapsack problem, Operations Research Letters 32 (2004) 2–14]. We propose improved reduction tests for the NGCP and a cutting-plane approach to be used in the first level of the tree search to compute effective upper bounds. Computational tests on problems derived from the literature show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, that is able to reduce the number of nodes generated at the first level of the tree search and the number of times the existence of a feasible packing layout is tested.}

    abstract = {A relevant financial planning problem is the periodical rebalance of a portfolio of assets such that the portfolio's total value exhibits certain characteristics. This problem can be modelled using a transition graph G to represent the future state space evolution of the corresponding economy and mathematically formulated as a linear programming problem. We present two different mathematical formulations of the problem. The first considers explicitly the set of the possible scenarios (scenario-based approach), while the second considers implicitly the whole set of scenarios provided by the graph G (graph-based approach). Unfortunately, for both the formulations the size of the corresponding linear programs can be huge even for simple financial problems. However, the graph-based approach seems to be a more powerful model, since it allows to consider a huge number of scenarios in a very compact formulation. The purpose of this paper is to present both heuristic and exact methods for the solution of large-scale multi-period financial planning problems using the graph-based model. In particular, in this paper we propose lower and upper bounds and three exact methods based on column, row and column/row generation, respectively. Since the methods based on column/row generation exploits simultaneously both the primal and the dual structure of the problem we call it Criss-Cross generation method. Computational results are given to prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}

Subgradient optimization is used to optimize the bound derived from the Lagrangean relaxation. Problem reduction tests derived from both the original problem and the Lagrangean relaxation are given. Incorporating the bound and the reduction tests into a tree search procedure enables moderately sized problems to be solved.}

In this paper we deal with the special case where there is just one available container and the objective is to maximize the total volume (or the total utility value, supposing that each box has a utility value) of the loaded boxes. We firstly present three heuristic solution methods for the unconstrained problem. Two of them solve the original three-dimensional problem by layers and by stacks reducing it into several problems with lower dimensions. The third one consists of representing possible loading patterns as complete paths in an AND/OR-graph. Bounds and heuristics are proposed in order to reduce the solution space. A proper heuristic is also given to treat the constrained problem by using the AND/OR-graph approach. Moreover, computational results are presented by solving a number of examples.}

Underperformance results in unnecessary costs (e.g. cost of additional containers to be shipped) and in an unsatisfactory customer service (e.g. violation of deadlines agreed to or set by clients). Thus, it is not surprising that container loading problems have been dealt with frequently in the operations research literature. It has been claimed though that the proposed approaches are of limited practical value since they do not pay enough attention to constraints encountered in practice. In this paper, a review of the state-of-the-art in the field of container loading will be given. We will identify factors which – from a practical point of view – need to be considered when dealing with container loading problems and we will analyze whether and how these factors are represented in methods for the solution of such problems. Modeling approaches, as well as exact and heuristic algorithms will be reviewed. This will allow for assessing the practical relevance of the research which has been carried out in the field. We will also mention several issues which have not been dealt with satisfactorily so far and give an outlook on future research opportunities.}

One is designed to produce stable, evenly distributed packing patterns; the other caters for multi-drop loads. A comprehensive performance analysis using both published and randomly generated test problems is presented. The procedure used to create the latter is described in full to enable replication. It is shown that the two methods, when combined, provide a powerful and versatile tool.}

Such problems enforce non-overlapping constraints which ensure that the smaller items being assigned must completely fit inside their respective container.

Therefore, the primary ambition of the present research is to provide a comparative study of the most significant exact methods which have been designed for two variants of this problem class: the Single Large Object Placement Problem and the Single Knapsack Problem. By adapting the selected methods in accordance with the problems being analyzed, a detailed comparison is possible via experimentation using classic benchmarks datasets and newly-generated instances using a Cutting and Packing Generator from the literature. Over 15,000 h of experiments provide information concerning which methods perform best for the considered problems in addition to the scaling behavior and influence of the percentage of the larger item occupancy for each of the tested methods. These results provide further insight concerning performance improvements of existing exact methods and the development of new formulations.}

A standard simple heuristic, Bottom-Left-Decreasing (BLD), has been shown to perform quite well in practice. We introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of BLD*, a stochastic search variation of BLD. While BLD places the rectangles in decreasing order of height, width, area, and perimeter, BLD* successively tries random orderings, chosen from a distribution determined by their Kendall-tau distance from one of these fixed orderings. Our experiments on benchmark problems show that BLD* produces significantly better packings than BLD after only 1 min of computation. Furthermore, we also show that BLD* outperforms recently reported metaheuristics. Furthermore, we observe that people seem able to reason about packing problems extremely well. We incorporate our new algorithms in an interactive system that combines the advantages of computer speed and human reasoning. Using the interactive system, we are able to quickly produce significantly better solutions than BLD* by itself.},

A placement algorithm usually takes a list of shapes, sorted by some property such as increasing height or decreasing area, and then applies a placement rule to each of these shapes in turn. The proposed method is not restricted to the first shape encountered but may dynamically search the list for better candidate shapes for placement. We suggest an efficient implementation of our heuristic and show that it compares favourably to other heuristic and metaheuristic approaches from the literature in terms of both solution quality and execution time. We also present data for new problem instances to encourage further research and greater comparison between this and future methods. }

Both solution approaches were compared, based on the trim losses of the test problems. Also, the influences of the GA parameters (population sizes, mutation rates, crossover techniques) and of the SA parameters (cooling schedules, neighborhood moves, the number of inner loop, different temperature values) on the solution of these problems were examined.

Until now mainly heuristics, for example genetic algorithms (GA), were proposed for the 2D-SPP which use encoded solutions that are manipulated by standard operators. In this paper a GA for the 2D-SPP is suggested that works without any encoding of solutions. Rather fully defined layouts are manipulated as such by means of specific genetic operators. Two additional constraints, namely the orientation constraint and the guillotine constraint, can be taken into account. The GA is subjected to a comprehensive test using benchmark instances with up to 5000 pieces. Compared to eleven competing methods from the literature the GA performs best.}
